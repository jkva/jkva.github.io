Yesterday I helped some friends clean up their shed. In a dusty corner I [spotted an  antenna](/images/posts/2014-12-31_antenna_1.jpg). Sure, I could take it home for free no problem.
Upon closer inspection at home it turned out to be a [Procom CXL 2-1LW/h](/images/posts/2014-12-31_antenna_2.jpg). After asking some hams on-line it was confirmed that I should be able
to use it on the 2 meter VHF band.

Who knows... time to study up on antennas! Happy new year.
