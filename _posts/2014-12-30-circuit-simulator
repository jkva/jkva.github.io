I've been getting into electronics recently as a side-effect of getting into amateur radio and studying for my license. 
Given that electronics was entirely new to me, I've been spending lots of time researching online. 

Some days ago I came across [this handy applet](http://www.falstad.com/circuit/).
It's a neat little thing that comes with a load of preconfigured circuits as well as the ability to make your own.

Even if this stuff is second nature to you, it still is fun to see how it all hangs together. For myself it's a great illustration
of how the various theories and components behave together 'in practice'.
