I'd been waiting for this [first ever frontender meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Frontend-Developer-Meetup-Amsterdam/events/217422482/)
for a while. Over a hundred(!) people had signed up, signifying front-end development being alive and kicking in Amsterdam.

The meetup was hosted at [Publitas](http://publitas.com/) in Amsterdam. It was easy to find and the Domino's delivery guys were
leaving as we arrived. After registering it was time for some socialising with beer and pizza.

Since the meetup was organized by [thefrontendlab](http://www.thefrontendlab.com/) they gave an introduction into their specialisation
in front-ender position recruiting. After that it was time for the first talk.

Michiel van der Ros from [Bigger Boat](http://biggerboat.nl/) spoke on creating games in the browser using HTML5 and JS. Very cool talk! Using panorama fotos a 3d surrounding effect
was simulated, combined with 'hotspots' for user interaction, as in the old Sierra/SCUMM style adventure games of yore. Very nice!

Afterwards Doruk Eker from [Quince](http://www.quince.nl/) spoke on using Unity3D and mobile devices to achieve augmented reality to use in
interactive store displays. A very interesting sector. They even got the classic Asteroids game to be played, using a smartphone as controller. Cool!

The last talk was by Maarten Verbaarschot, he spoke briefly on using [CQRS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CQRS) within the browser. He had implemented
CQRS command support using AngularJS directives. While being hard to follow, the subject matter was interesting, however I doubt the practicality
of implementing proper CQRS on the browser side, unless you're going to combine it with proper event sourcing to provide an immutable data model towards
the view side of things. But it's cool to see people experimenting with this.

Afterwards I had quite a trip home ahead of me so I had to bounce. It was a fun evening and I'm looking forward to the next one.
