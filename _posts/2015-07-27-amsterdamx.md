Having not attended an [AmsterdamX](http://amsterdamx.pm.org/) meetup for a while, I had heard that tonight's one featured
a talk on Perl support for IntelliJ IDEA. I was not disappointed, what a great bunch of talks.

## Eli Abramovitch - Breathing life into perl with an Intellij Plugin

Eli spoke enthusiastically about the recent development of Perl support in the IntelliJ IDE and showed a real live demo of
syntax support, type inference, autocompletion, and more. I was especially impressed by the speed!

Being a daily user of IntelliJ, I love this. I tend to use Vim or SublimeText to write Perl, and having the ecosystem of 
IntelliJ at my disposal, I can be a lot more productive.

The devs are working on formatting support, testing integration, and more. Find out more at [Github](https://github.com/hurricup/Perl5-IDEA).

## Maxim Vuets - Processing toki pona with Perl

Maxim gave a talk (beginning on a whiteboard, no less) on the fictional language [Toki Pona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona).
He explained the grammar basics, language intricacies (tiny lexical base, heavily context-dependent) and even showed us a
Toki Pona subtitled version of the "We found a witch" scene from Monty Python and the Quest for the Holy Grail :)

Using a formal grammar definition, he showed usage of the Perl interface to [Marpa](https://metacpan.org/pod/Marpa::R2) to 
parse a grammar. He demonstrated how it could be used to form S-expressions (as seen in Lisp) and that it could even
be instructed to deal with ambiguous statements. Very impressive and interesting!

## Mathias RÃ¸rbo Jessen - PowerShell - Next-level Automation in Windows-land

Mathias gave an interesting talk about Windows PowerShell, how it came to be, and interestingly, ways in which it has been
influenced by Perl. I haven't administered Microsoft systems for some years, and it was nice to hear the decisions Microsoft
went through to create PowerShell as we know it, and why those decisions were made, as well as the people involved.

Especially interesting was how they looked at the Unix philosophy of commands taking a text stream as input and producing a
text stream as output, how this was used to chain commands, and how this could be improved, and more standardized.

I very much liked that PowerShell allows you to actually use objects, and thus use method calls as you otherwise would when scripting,
but in the shell.

### All good stuff

All in all a very nice, well spent evening. I even raded a bottle of '12 homemade mead for webmind's homemade Madame Jeanette Chili!
Thanks to the speakers and attendees, and thanks to [Booking.com](http://www.booking.com) for hosting this AmsterdamX meetup.
