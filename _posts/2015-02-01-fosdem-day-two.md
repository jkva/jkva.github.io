Day two of FOSDEM was not very eventful. I had been hoping to spend most of my time in the Software Defined Radio room,
but due to the popularity of the subject, this room was regularly full. Too bad! But great to see a rise in the popularity
of amateur radio and radio communication in general.

I spent most of my time visiting the various stands, chatting with stand holders and attending the occasional talk here and there.
There were some interesting talks about dealing with time discrepancies (leap year synchronisation, et al) so definitely not
a wasted day.

Looking forward to 2016... :)
