Happy 2015!

Having recently visited a hackerspace day on RTL-SDR, I'd been thinking of trying it out to see if I could listen to local CB and ham on shortwave.
After some searching on the [rtl-sdr subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/rtlsdr) I ended up buying [this LogiLink model](https://www.conrad.nl/nl/dvb-t-tv-stick-logilink-usb-20-receiver-met-dvb-t-antenne-opnamefunctie-aantal-tuners-1-1000012.html?sc.ref=Search+Results)
based on the compatible chipset.

Some googling later I stumbled on [a helpful blog post](https://www.jeroennijhof.nl/wiki/index.php?title=Software-Defined_Radio_on_Ubuntu) by a fellow who happens to have the same receiver, and some minutes
later I was running [gqrx](http://gqrx.dk/).

So far I've not gotten great signals. I've played around with the gain but not much luck. I'll be trying a faster laptop - it seems my old EEEpc (1GB ram, ouch) is too weak - and perhaps fashion a stronger antenna. But otherwise it's fun to play around with this.
