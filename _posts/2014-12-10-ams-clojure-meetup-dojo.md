Having been interested in [Clojure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clojure) for a while now, it seemed
the right decision to attend one of the [Amsterdam Clojure Meetup Group](http://www.meetup.com/The-Amsterdam-Clojure-Meetup-Group/)'s
meetups. The one I went to tonight was hosted at [Elmar Reizen](http://www.elmar.nl/) located on the
Herengracht in Amsterdam.

The entrance was clearly marked with the Clojure symbol, nice. After calling a cell number I was granted
entry. At the fifth floor already a number of people had gathered, and there was pizza and beer. Great!

Elmar Reizen uses a combination of Scala, Ruby, and in increasing amounts, [ClojureScript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript).
After some discussion on programming language semantics, we were informed that tonight was a pair programming
evening, where newbies were to be combined with experienced Clojurians. Being a Clojure beginner I got paired
with [@wvdlaan](https://twitter.com/wvdlaan). We used his computer since it was already all set up.

The problem to be solved for the evening was a [Nonogram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram) solver. We worked using
the [Pomodoro Technique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) - 25 minutes programming alternated
by a 5 minute break.

Walter started by explaining a bit on Clojure syntax semantics and showed the REPL. He used Emacs as an editor
which was nice, I'd not yet seen that in action. After some discussion we came up with a recursive algorithm that
seemed easy to parallelise as well. However we were already in our 3rd pomodoro cycle and I needed to head towards home.

All in all it was a fun evening. Interesting people and a nice introduction to Clojure and what makes it fun.
