After missing last year's, I had been looking forward to this year's FOSDEM for a while. In 2013 the ADA devroom was a blast
and this year we had the promise of Larry Wall telling us to get ready to party for Perl 6!

We (SWMBO and yours truly) found a lovely BnB in a quiet region of Brussels, at about 20 minutes of walking distance.
The first morning you get the 'conference feeling', at least I do. We ran into some Perl programmers we knew in the first
five minutes of being there. Awesome. There's just something about a group of people that you only socialise with in person
at conferences.

Inside there is the booktable. Ahhh. The booktable! Always busy, but I still got away with two books - [Good Math](https://pragprog.com/book/mcmath/good-math)
and [Minecraft Plugins](https://pragprog.com/book/ahmine/learn-to-program-with-minecraft-plugins). The latter mostly for shits and giggles, as it
is very much targeted towards the novice. But there's just nothing like the feeling of buying a book.

And of course, the talks. I spent most of the first day switching between the Perl and Ada rooms. Mostly in the Ada room, though.
It really is a fascinating language. This year the room was definitely a lot more full, especially during the "Introduction to Ada" talk.

The day was finished with a nice dinner organized by the Perl Community's very own Wendy van Dijk. It was great to see everyone!
